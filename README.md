# Weather App

This web app is referred to [the tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6trGQWzg2AI) by Asish George Tech on Youtube.

I add a backup plan as the app makes use with [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) which needs the user to agree to share the position of the device with the app.

[The weather info](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api), and [the weather icons](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions) both use OpenWeatherMap service.

I also add a search function that allows the user to input a city name to get the weather. The city location info is also provided by [Geocoding API](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api) from OpenWeatherMap.

The font is: [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins#standard-styles) | Google Fonts.
